### Takaways from Exploratory Data Analysis using NYC MTA Turnstile data

Week one of the Metis Data Science saw us wade neck deep into analyzing data - in its full glory, and I kid you not - it was messy! But the final outcome was something, which as a rank newcomer - I was proud of!

This project was designed such that we would face the rigors of understanding the data, clean it and analyze it come up with recommendations for a fictional client. Women Yes Women Tech (WYWT) International wanted us to analyze the [MTA Turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to suggest where to place their street team of volunteers to maximize sign-ups for their cause and increase attendance in their summer gala.

Now, why MTA turnstile data, you may ask.

### NYC MTA turnstile data

>In 2016, average weekday subway ridership was 5.7 million, the highest since 1948. Annual ridership was 1.757 billion.
[MTA info](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm)

Given this ridership, it should come as no surprise that the data from the turnstiles - that register the traffic through the New York subway system at each entrance of each station every four hours - would be ideal for our analysis. Given the rather [low response rates (10-12%) for external surveys](https://www.surveygizmo.com/resources/blog/survey-response-rates/), identifying stations with the highest footfalls could yield a good conversion rate, i.e, more donors to WYWT's cause.

Given that WYWT would hold their gala in summer, we pulled out the turnstile data for the months preceding it, from March to May and used it for our analysis.

Based on our cleaned-up data (maybe I should go over how we did all that in another blog post?), we came up with a list of top stations with the highest footfalls. We focussed on the number of exits from any given station, as we inferred that people would be more amenable to chatting with volunteers at their destination.

### Our recommendations

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

*
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)
