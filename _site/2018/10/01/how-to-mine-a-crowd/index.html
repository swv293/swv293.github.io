<p>Week one of the <a href="https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps">Metis Data Science Bootcamp</a> saw us wade neck deep into analyzing data - in its full glory, and I kid you not - it was messy! But the final outcome was something, which as a rank newcomer - I was proud of!</p>

<p>This project was designed such that we would face the rigors of understanding the data, clean it and analyze it to come up with recommendations for a fictional client. Women Yes Women Tech (WYWT) International wanted us to analyze the <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html">MTA Turnstile data</a> to suggest where to place their street team of volunteers to maximize sign-ups for their cause and increase attendance in their summer gala.</p>

<p>Now, why MTA turnstile data, you may ask.</p>

<h3 id="nyc-mta-turnstile-data">NYC MTA turnstile data</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2016, average weekday subway ridership was 5.7 million, the highest since 1948. Annual ridership was 1.757 billion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm">MTA info</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given this ridership, it should come as no surprise that the data from the turnstiles - that register the traffic through the New York subway system at each entrance of each station every four hours - would be ideal for our analysis. Given the rather <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/resources/blog/survey-response-rates/">low response rates (10-12%) for external surveys</a>, identifying stations with the highest footfalls could yield a good conversion rate, i.e, more donors to WYWT’s cause.</p>

<p>Given that WYWT would hold their gala in summer, we pulled out the turnstile data for the months preceding it, from March to May and used it for our analysis.</p>

<p>Based on our cleaned-up data (maybe I should go over how we did all that in another blog post?), we came up with a list of top stations with the highest footfalls. We focussed on the number of exits from any given station, as we inferred that people would be more amenable to chatting with volunteers at their destination.</p>

<p>WYWT is looking to expand on its donor base through the street campaign, so we decided to add income data from Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/goldenoakresearch/us-household-income-stats-geo-locations">household income data</a>), to supplement the footfall data and get more meaning into our analysis.</p>

<p>We identified the zipcodes around our top stations and mapped the income distribution around these locations.</p>

<p><img src="images/Income_map.png" alt="income distribution" />
GPS locations of the income distribution. Darker circles indicate higher incomes.</p>

<p>We also devised a simple algorithm that mapped both footfall and income data into a single function, adding weights to each component so that we could tweak the recommendations towards either income heavy stations or footfall heavy stations, based on the client’s preference.</p>

    <p>List of top fifty stations based on our combined income and footfall ranking system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mondays and Fridays are the best days for positioning street teams at the exits of the stations to maximize their impact as the ridership peaks on those days.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/exits_week.png" alt="Exits and the day of the week" />
The turnstile data was separated by the days of the week and aggregated over the entire period of 13 weeks to give rise to the distribution of exits over the days of the week for selected stations with the shadow being the 95% confidence interval around each line plot.</p>

<p>Note: Wednesday traffic seem to be fluctuating more than any other day for the period we analyzed.</p>

<p>Off to week two and web scraping! Keep an eye on this blog for more updates in the coming weeks! I leave you with some interesting quotes on data from some truly learned people!</p>
